# Logo Assets

Place your logo files here:
- `logo.png` - Main logo (recommended: 512x512px or similar square ratio)
- `logo-wide.png` - Wide version for README header (recommended: 1200x300px)
- `social-preview.png` - For GitHub social preview (recommended: 1280x640px)

## Adding Logo to Repository

1. **In README**: Already set up! Just uncomment the line in README.md and update the filename
2. **As Social Preview**: Go to Settings → Options → Social preview → Upload an image

The social preview is what appears when you share your repo on social media or in link previews.
